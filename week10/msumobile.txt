With the MSU mobile site, you notice right away it is a close copy to the full web site that you would access on a computer. The same main buttons and links are available that you would get on a computer, and there is also a button that takes you to the full site if that is what you prefer. I like the customization button where you can hide and rearrange buttons.

I really like the search area. Now, most mobile sites have a search field, but MSU has theirs really stand out. It is very easy to navigate to what you want using this search box rather then clicking through the navigation buttons. There really is not anything to complain about. A viewer can get to the exact same information using the mobile site or full site, and if there truly is not something they cant find they could use the link to the full site on the home page of the mobile site.
