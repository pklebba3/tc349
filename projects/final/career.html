	<p>After receiving my degree from <a href="http://www.msu.edu" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a> I will be joining <a href="http://deloitte.com" target="_blank"> Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>.  Deloitte is the largest professional services firm in the World.  Often referred to as the Big 4, the other main firms are Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and KPMG. Comparable to the Big 3 automotive companies, these four companies are the leaders around the world. Below is a picture of Deloitte's training facility in Dallas, Texas.  This was built specifically for employees to travel to for various training and educational seminars. </p>
	<h2>Internships</h2>
	<h3 class="first">Blue Cross Blue Shield</h3>
	<p>My first internship was with BCBSM in the Summer of 2011. I worked in IT (Information Technology) in a insurance claims department. Unfortunatley, this experience did nothing specifically for my future work, but it was my first true work experience. I learned a lot about business and what it was like to work full-time, 40 hours every week.</p>
	<h3 class="first">Deloitte</h3>
	<p>This past summer I was a Security &amp; Privacy intern for Deloitte. All of Deloitte's work is client based, so there is a lot of travel involved. Every week, I would fly out on Monday to my client in Pennsylvania and come back home on Thursday's. This was really fun and gave me a feel for what my future holds. Upon completion of this program, I was offered a full-time job, and quickly accpeted.</p>
	<h2>Future</h2>
	<p>I will be taking the summer off to travel and relax before I start full-time.  I plan on starting in August or September, but do not know my official start date. I am very excited to start.  As a Security Consultant, I will be traveling a lot to the client site. This will most likely be out of state.</p>
