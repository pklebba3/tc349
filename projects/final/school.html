	<p>My four years at Michigan State University have been amazing.  I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. I grew up a Michigan fan, so being at MSU was a little strange. I can say that I have never been a die hard MSU sports fan, like most people who go here.</p>
	<h2>High School &amp; College</h2>
		<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.lakeorion.k12.mi.us/lohs/" target="_blank">Lake Orion High School</a> in 2009. My final gpa there was a 3.75. It is amazing how easy high school is compared to college. My first semester at MSU was difficult. I had no idea what to expect, and I studied like I did in high school, which was a mistake. Look over the notes for about an hour the night before and everything would be good, but not here. I started off with a 2.95 gpa after my first semester, and have raised that number every semester. I should have around a 3.5 once I graduate, which is in May 2013.</p>
