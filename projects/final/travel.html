	<p>I have been very lucky over the last 22 years to be able to travel all over the country with athletics and family. </p>
	<h2>Hockey</h2>
	<p>I was lucky to play on some really good travel teams growing up, which allowed me to see the country while traveling to play. Ever since I was about 7, my teams would make countless trips to Canada to play in tournaments. One year, a couple of teams from Russia came over here to play some of the US's best and my team was the only one who beat both successfully.</p>
	<h2>Family Trips</h2>
	<p>Every summer and winter my family tries to go on one big trip. For about 15 years now, we have gone up to Mackinac Island with another family and we always look forward to this. It is so nice up there, very peaceful and quiet. Our most recent trips were to California (Hollywood, Huntington Beach, Malibu) and New York.</p>
	<h2>Future</h2>
	<p>I have wanted to go to Bora Bora for a long time.  If you have seen the movie Couples Retreat with Vince Vaughn, this is the place they travel to. The "rooms" are these big huts that sit over the water. You can see this beautiful place below.</p>
