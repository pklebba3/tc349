	<p>During the warm months, I spend a lot of time on the water. Some of my favorite activities on the water are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wakeboarding</li>
		<li>Tubing</li>
		<li>Water Skiing</li>
		<li>Wakeskating</li>
		<li>Relaxing in the middle where all the boats go to relax</li>
	</ul> 
	<p>Growing up, I played hockey for about 15 years.  During that time, I made several National teams, won a State and National Championship, and defeated teams from all around the World.</p>
