	<p>After receiving my degree from <a href="http://www.msu.edu" target="_blank">Michigan State University </a> I will be joining <a href="http://deloitte.com" target="_blank"> Deloitte</a>.  Deloitte is the largest professional services firm in the World.  Often referred to as the Big 4, the other main firms are Ernst and Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and KPMG.
