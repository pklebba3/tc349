As soon as you get to the site, Happy Cog greets you with a fun, vibrant home page.  There are fun emphasis animations when you hover over different components that are subtle but well represented.  They do a bit of name-dropping with MTV and Zappos.  It appears that these two companies are their largest clients, and it shows they have so popular and famous people who contacted them for their service.

One interesting aspect that I noticed was everything, meaning all of the content is on the main page.  When you click a navigation button at the top, you are not taken to a new page, but the site scrolls down the page to the corresponding area.  I like at the bottom with the contact section, it shows using google maps where their three main offices are.  Also, allowing you to click on any of the maps and taken to google maps to find how to get there.
