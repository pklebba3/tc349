Etsy is a really good looking web site, and it is "relaxing" to look at.  There is a lot of information on the page, but the way it is styled gives it a clean look and feel.  Part of this is due to the padding around the wording.  The soft, light background color makes the words that are important pop off the screen.

The navigation at the top of the page is very easy to find and navigate.  I like how the Community and Blogs tab has a drop down when you hover over it, allowing you to get directly to the page you are looking for with fewer steps in between.
