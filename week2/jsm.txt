	Right of the bat, I was very confused what this page was showing.  I didn't know if the Santa Maria was referring to a name or the famous ship.  My recommendation would be to add a introduction to the home page and describe what the web site is used for and trying to convey.  I do like the timeline feature because it delivers a crisp, clean feel and look to the page, but like I said, it should now be the first thing to come up.

	Looking at the different tabs on the top now, I like how the articles page has a filter where the viewer can click on a popular word and find the articles that word is in.  It was a little disappointing the portfolio page is still under construction, but it is very nice the creator set a link to where the work can be found.  I think the "About" page would be perfect for the home page.  It lets the viewer know they are looking at an artist's web site.  Like I said above, I didn't know if I was reading a timeline of the Santa Maria ship, or whatever else it could have been.
