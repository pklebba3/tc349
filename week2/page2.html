	<h2>School</h2>
	<p>I am a senior at Michigan State University.  My major is Media and Communication Technology, concentrating in Information Technology and specializing in Security Management.</p>
	<h2>Career</h2>
	<p>Last summer I completed an internship with Deloitte & Touche, who operates out of the Renaissance Center in Detroit.  I was working in their Security & Privacy service area.  Upon completion of that program, I was offered a full-time position with them.  I quickly accepted and cannot wait to start working full-time for them this coming Fall.
