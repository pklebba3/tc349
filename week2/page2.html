	<h2>School</h2>
	<p>I am a senior at Michigan State University.  My major is Media and Communication Technology, concentrating in Information Technology and specializing in Security Management.</p>
	<h2>Career</h2>
	<p>Last summer I completed an internship with Deloitte & Touche, who operates out of the Renaissance Center in Detroit.  I was working in their Security & Privacy service area.  Upon completion of that program, I was offered a full-time position with them.  I quickly accepted and cannot wait to start working full-time for them this coming Fall.
	<h2>Panic.com</h2>
	<p>Right off the bat, I was astonished by the quality of the images.  The small details that you can see (they really pop out at you) are incredible.  The homepage is very clean and simple to navigate.  It is very obvious to the viewer what this company and website is all about.  I love how when you hover over each of the applications, there is a brief explanation of what it is that pops up.  If you want further details, you can click on the image.</p>
		<p>I think it is a little odd, in my opinion, that this company has tshirts.  I honestly cannot imagine many people buy these shirts.  The company provides great services, but personally, the shirts seem a little over the top.  Lastly, I love the shopping cart on this site.  I have never seen anything like it.  You simply grab an item that you want to purchase and drag it to the bottom of the page to add it to your shopping cart.</p>
