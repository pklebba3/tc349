	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Phil Klebba is a senior at Michigan State University, who is from Lake Orion, Michigan.  He is studying Information Technology and Security Management, and is drawn to cyber-security.  Upon graduation this May, Phil will start working full-time for Deloitte & Touche in their Security & Privacy service area, where he completed an internship program last summer.  In his spare time, you will find Phil relaxing at his house with his friends usually watching sports or the King of Queens.  Phil lives by the motto “to get something you never had, you must do something you never did.”</p>
	<h2>Panic.com</h2>
	<p>Right off the bat, I was astonished by the quality of the images.  The small details that you can see (they really pop out at you) are incredible.  The homepage is very clean and simple to navigate.  It is very obvious to the viewer what this company and website is all about.  I love how when you hover over each of the applications, there is a brief explanation of what it is that pops up.  If you want further details, you can click on the image.</p>
		<p>I think it is a little odd, in my opinion, that this company has tshirts.  I honestly cannot imagine many people buy these shirts.  The company provides great services, but personally, the shirts seem a little over the top.  Lastly, I love the shopping cart on this site.  I have never seen anything like it.  You simply grab an item that you want to purchase and drag it to the bottom of the page to add it to your shopping cart.</p>
