	<p> This graphic shows the results of the card sorting experiment I help with 3 of my roommates.  I gave them the headings "Create", "Media" and "Company", and instructed them to put the topics under the appropriate title.  The reason there is only one chart here is because 3/4 (including my response) had the same results.  The outlier in the group put Contact under the "Media" heading.

	<p>To gather the above information, I wrote out the different topics covered on the page.  These are the headings on the top of the chart.  I showed the website to 3 of my roommates and then gave the stack of notecards to them.  They proceeded to rank the headings from most important to least important.  The above chart shows the rankings each "card" received from the corresponding recepient.  As you can see the most important element across the board was the Create Page where users can create their own Foldable.  This result falls in line with the site.  On the page, a large "Create Yours" button greets the viewer as soon as the page opens.  It is in another color then all other buttons on the page, and really grabs your attention.
