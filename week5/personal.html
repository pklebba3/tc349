	<p> To gather the above information, I wrote out the different items I wanted to cover and told 3 friends to sort them.  They put them into groups, and the above chart shows the average results.  There were some minor differences, for example, putting travel into hobbies.  This graph shows a simple redering of what my current personal site looks like, with some additions and improvements.  I think what was found between my roommates and my responses is the best way to show the information. </p>
