From the first seconds you are on Chartbeat, you can easily notice how "techy" it is.  Scrolling down the page, you are captivated by the different numbers, imgaes and moving parts that are on the site.  I love how it updates data as you are on the page.  For example, it tells you how many pixels you have scrolled since being on the page.  It is an extremely clean site, and very easy to find what you are looking for.  If you are just browsing the site, you can easily depict the most important parts due to the structure and color choices.

The site appears to be very technical, and somewhat difficult to understand what the actual service is.  Unless you know what the site is, and have your own mission with being there, it may be hard to follow it.
