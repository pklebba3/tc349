The website for MSU is very modern and high tech.  There are a lot of moving parts, yet is extremely user friendly.  The key headings and everything important really jumps out of the screen.  The homepage gives the viewer a preview of everything on the site, and once the user decides what to focus on there is an easy to decipher header at the top.

One of my favorite parts of Michigan State's site is when you click in the search bar on the page, a "popular links" section drops down.  This area consists of common pages where a lot of people goto more often then others, for example, email, Angel and Stuinfo.  I quickly went to the U of M webpage to do a little compare and contrast.  On Michigan's page they have a link for prospective students to click on, and on MSU's, people have to click on "Students" before they find the prospective students page.  However, Michigan has a much more crowded homepage and a lot of the writing is the same size font so it blends together.
