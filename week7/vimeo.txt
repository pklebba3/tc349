Vimeo is a very user-friendly web site for people to watch endless videos.  Very similiar to youtube, but up to this point, does not carry the same popularity.  I have personally used Vimeo extensively and have had no complaints yet.  One thing I really like about the homepage is the "What can you do here" portion.  We have visited several sites this semester and many of them fail to relate the page to the viewer who just stumbled to the page.  They never explain what you could do on the site, but Vimeo does very well.  

Below that section, they go into detail why their page is different, or "better" as they say.  Throughout the homepage, you can see easily how user-friendly the site is, and they pride themselves on that point.  They say it is not necessary for any technology knowledge prior to using their site.  Once you get into the interior of Vimeo, it is very easy to naviagate from one section to the other, and seamlessly view several videos with ease.
