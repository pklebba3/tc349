NHL.com is very close to an exact copy of the full site. All the attributes and characteristics are the same (colors, fonts, shades, etc.). It is very simple, and borderline too simple. Scroll down past the image that is on both the main site and mobile site for the day, and there are 10+ navigation buttons that will take you to the desired section of the site.

This button-heavy home page, to me, is nice. I like it because it is very straight forward and easy to get around. There are a lot of possible buttons, but it beats having to open up a drop down and then proceed to click another button. This style used by NHL.com cuts out the "middleman". One feature I like is when you open up the mobile site in safari, it prompts you to download the free app from the app store, and if clicked will take you right to it.
