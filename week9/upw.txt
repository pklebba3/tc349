The United Pixelworkers web site is very modern and clean. Almost copying an IPhone look with the gallery style layout. It is easy to focus on one thing, meaning there is no clutter. You can move from item to item with ease. I am not sure how I feel about the showcase of roughly 50 shirts at the bottom of the homepage. There is a navigation link at the top which moves you to the "Collection" where all the shirts are shown. I think there is enough on the homepage as it is, the shirts are not needed.

I love the Jobs section. Most companies have a "Contact Us" for their job inquiries, but United Pixelworkers lists what jobs are open and where they are located. It takes away an aggravating step in the process. They also have a very cool social media page. It is a collection of Instagram posts that included #uprollcall (United Pixelworkers hashtag), and anyone who posts a picture with that hashtag can find their post on this page.

A lot of sites do not feature a FAQ page as well, and in most cases, they need one. It takes a lot of the guessing away from what should be easy situations. For example, they cover shipping, what to do if you ordered the wrong size, etc. A very appreciated page personally.
