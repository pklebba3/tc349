I have chosen to use Textmate and since it is now an open source, I was able to download a free version.  I like how clean and simple it is.  While I was working on the hello.html file, I noticed it highlight some characters when there may be mistakes, which will be very helpful down the road.  This environment, terminal and github have and will take some time to "fully" understand, but I think I am inching closer and closer.  It will just take some patience and practice.
